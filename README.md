# socket_lab

socket_lab is a Python CLI application built ontop of Click and was designed as a proof of concept exercise to learn networking with Python. The project may grow into a framework but is currently largely a coding exercise. Goals include implementing proxies, ARP poisoning, or could grow into something arbitrary related to the requests and sockets libraries.

## Credits
Much of the current placeholder code is based around code from [Justin Seitz](https://nostarch.com/blackhatpython) in his book Black Hat Python.
